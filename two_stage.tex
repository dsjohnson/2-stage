\centerline{\bf Abstract} 
We propose a multistage method for making inference at all levels of a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) using natural data partitions to increase efficiency by allowing computations to take place in parallel form using software that is most appropriate for each data partition. The full hierarchical model is then approximated by the product of independent normal distributions for the data component of the model. In the second stage, the Bayesian maximum {\it a posteriori} (MAP) estimator is found by maximizing the approximated posterior density with respect to the parameters. If the parameters of the model can be represented as normally distributed random effects then the second stage optimization is equivalent to fitting a multivariate normal linear mixed model. This method can be extended to account for common fixed parameters shared between data partitions, as well as parameters that are distinct between partitions. In the case of distinct parameter estimation, we consider a third stage that re-estimates the distinct parameters for each data partition based on the results of the second stage. This allows more information from the entire data set to properly inform the posterior distributions of the distinct parameters. The method is demonstrated with two ecological data sets and models, a random effects GLM and an Integrated Population Model (IPM). We used standard GLM software available in {\tt R} for the first stage of the GLM analysis, and multiple software platforms for the IPM analysis. In both examples the {\tt R} package {\tt TMB} was used to fit the second stage linear mixed model. The multistage results were compared to estimates from models fit in single stages to the entire data set. Both examples demonstrate that multistage point and posterior standard deviation estimates closely approximate those obtained from fitting the models with all data simultaneously and can therefore be considered for fitting hierarchical Bayesian models when it is computationally prohibitive to do so in one step.

\section{Introduction}


Bayesian hierarchical models (BHMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields of scientific enquiry because of their ability to flexibly model complex natural systems yet remain relatively easy to build and modify for the questions at hand \citep{hobbs2015bayesian}. \citet{berliner1996hierarchical} influenced the general description of a BHM based on three submodels: (1) {\it data}, (2) {\it process}, and (3) {\it parameter} models. The data model accounts for measurement error or other differences between observable data and the true natural process for which the researcher would like to make inference. The process model describes the state of nature using a random process to account for its unknown intricacies. Finally, the parameter model describes our uncertainty about the parameters governing this random process.  The full model is built by conditioning each submodel on the one above it. Traditionally, inference for BHMs has been conducted using some form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) because the model structure is ideally suited to it \citep{gelfand1990sampling,gelfand2015hierarchical}. If not for development of MCMC methods, widespread use of BHMs may never have come to pass \citep{green2015bayesian}. With a large amount of data or complex submodels, however, MCMC can be computationally challenging or infeasible to implement \citep{hooten2018prior, wikle2003hierarchical}. Herein, we propose a multistage method for making inference at all levels of an BHM using various various software formats in each stage. By breaking the estimation procedure into multiple stages based on a partition of the full data it becomes computationally efficient. By allowing use of the most suitable software platform in the initial stage it can be made more efficient yet, not only in computing time, but also in development time saved by using software designed to facilitate each specific initial stage analysis. 

To alleviate computational challenges in using MCMC to fit BHMs in ``big data'' situations there have been several avenues of approach  developing in the literature. One of these, is development of so called ``2-stage'' methods. These methods seek to break the computation into pieces based on partitions of the data \citep{goudie2019joining, hooten2016hierarchical,hooten2018prior,lunn2013fully,mesquita2020embarrassingly}. The first stage involves fitting separate data models to the partitions using MCMC, then in the second stage the separate MCMC samples are combined to produce an MCMC sample as if the partitions had been simultaneously analyzed with the full BHM. Before the wide-spread use of MCMC, \cite{kass1989approximate} considered a 2-stage estimation method for a specific class of BHMs known as {\it conditionally independent hierarchical models} (CIHMs). In these models data partitions are conditionally independent given parameter values. In another example of 2-stage inference for an BHM without MCMC, \citet{burnham2002evaluation} used meta-analysis methods to fit random effects models for capture-recapture survival data. Meta-analysis methods are designed as a 2-stage procedure where results of many separate analyses are combined using a linear mixed model to describe population average effects and account for estimation uncertainty in the first stage \citep{gasparrini2012multivariate,higgins2009re}. 

A second alternative approach to default MCMC for computationally challenging BHMs is to not use posterior sampling at all and, instead, use  optimization methods for exploring the posterior parameter space \citep{green2015bayesian}. Optimization of the posterior density aims to find the  {\it maximum a posteriori} (MAP) estimate rather than the posterior mean for a point estimate. The main benefit is that optimizing the posterior with respect to the parameters often requires fewer evaluations of the posterior density. That comes at a cost, however, because asymptotic results are usually required to describe parameter uncertainty \citep{van2000asymptotic}. The development of automatic differentiation software has aided the development of efficient optimization inference for BHMs \citep{kristensen2016tmb, skaug2006automatic}.

In an effort to provide a computationally efficient and flexible method for fitting BHMs, specifically, CIHMs, we consider combining benefits of meta-analysis, 2-stage MCMC, and posterior optimization into a multistage method that can be used to quickly fit BHMs in big data situations or when the data level models are complex in their own right. Although meta-analysis and 2-stage MCMC are both accomplished in multiple stages, 2-stage MCMC was initially designed to analyze a BHM, whereas meta-analysis seeks to summarize results from various analyses by forming them into an BHM, namely, a multivariate normal linear mixed model \citep{gasparrini2012multivariate}. We can use the meta-analysis approach to approximate the second stage combination of initial stage inference in a 2-stage MCMC. This allows us to use multiple approaches  to approximate the posterior inference in the initial stage, including optimization methods, deterministic sampling, or MCMC, if it is convenient. 

In what follows, we provide notation and a working definition of the CIHM as we will use it. We show how the full posterior can be approximated using multivariate normal approximations to first stage posterior densities. Then we demonstrate how the initial stage results can be combined using the linear mixed model approach of standard meta-analysis when the first stage parameters are random effects. We extend the method for estimating all types of parameters in the full CIHM. A third stage is introduced to retroactively revisit the first stage analysis and improve estimates after the second stage results are obtained. The method is then demonstrated for two different types of environmental data, a simple generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and an integrated data model for Bayesian melding. 


\section{Methods}

The description of BHMs by \cite{berliner1996hierarchical} is very general and we only consider a specific, but still very broad, class of hierarchical models here, CIHMs \citep{kass1989approximate,gelfand2015hierarchical}. The general form of a CIHM is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:full.model}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Data-level model: } & \bY = \{\by_1,\dots,\by_n\} \sim \prod_{i=1}^n[\by_i|\bt_i, \bg_i, \bn], \\
\text{Unit-level effects: } & \bT = \{\bt_1,\dots,\bt_n\} \sim \prod_{i=1}^n[\bt_i|\bp],\\
 & \bG = \{\bg_1,\dots,\bg_n\} \sim \prod_{i=1}^n[\bg_i], \\
\text{Population effects: } & \bP = \{\bp,\bn\} \sim [\bp,\bn],
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where ``$[A|B]$'' is used to represent the conditional probability density or distribution function of $A$ given $B$ \citep{gelfand1990sampling}, $\by_i$ is the observed data set (or data partition) for the $i$th unit, $\bt_i$ are unit-level parameters, $\bp$ are population-level parameters for $\bt_i$, $\bg_i$ are distinct parameters for modeling the $i$th data set, and $\bn$ are global (fixed) population level parameters. Typically, $\bp$ and $\bn$ are the most scientifically interesting, however, there can be interest in each of the $\bt_i$ and $\bg_i$ depending on the situation. Note that the different data sets do not need to contain the same type of data, that is, the units are not necessarily exchangeable individuals. Combining data via a BHM is often termed ``Bayesian melding''  \citep{goudie2019joining, liu2014bayesian}. See Section 4 for an example of Bayesian melding in an integrated population model. While this class of BHMs is large, in the discussion in Section 5, we show how this method can be expanded beyond CIHMs.


\subsection{Two-stage approximate Bayesian inference}

We begin our investigation of two-stage model fitting with individual-based hierarchical models. We assume, initially, that the data-level models can be written as $[\by_i|\bt_i, \bg_i, \bn]=[\by_i|\bt_i]$, that is, either there are no fixed parameters, or they can be absorbed into $\bp$ via, say, hierarchical centering \citep{Gelfand:1996zq}. We will return to the general CIHM in the following section. 

If we were to fit this model in the traditional way we would use summaries from the full posterior distribution 
\[
[\bp, \bT|\bY] \propto \left(\prod_i[\by_i|\bt_i][\bt_i|\bp]\right) [\bp].
\]
Using this type of hierarchical model in the presence of individual heterogeneity has many beneficial qualities for accurately assessing uncertainty when population-level inference is the main scientific interest \citep{Cressie:2009rr}. However, with modern data collection technology, the individual $\by_i$ data sets can become quite large and, if evaluating $[\by_i|\bt_i]$ is sufficiently complex, making inference to the full posterior distribution can become computationally challenging (e.g., \citealt{hooten2016hierarchical}).

To begin, suppose we only possess a single $\by_i$. Then we might estimate $\bt_i$ using the posterior distribution
\[
[\bt_i|\by_i] \propto [\by_i|\bt_i]\ [\bt_i],
\]
where $[\bt_i]$ is a prior distribution that would be used in the absence of additional individuals. We can accurately interpret this posterior as all of our knowledge about $\bt_i$ given $\by_i$ (and choice of $[\bt_i]$, but we address this momentarily). Using the individual posterior distributions, we can rewrite the full hierarchical model posterior as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:post}
\begin{aligned}[]
[\bp,\bT|\bY] &\propto [\bY|\bT]\ [\bT|\bp]\ [\bp]\\
& \propto \left(\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{[\bt_i|\by_i]}{[\bt_i]}\ [\bt_i|\bp]\right)\ [\bp].
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
After the data have been summarized into the posteriors the individual likelihoods, $\left[ \by_i \mid \bt_i \right]$, are not needed for full hierarchical modeling. 

When evaluating the posterior distribution in equation (\ref{eq:post}), the individual posteriors, $[\bt_i|\by_i]$ are typically not available in closed form. Many times one may fit an individual model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), therefore, $[\bt_i|\by_i]$ is represented by a stochastic sample. The method proposed by \citet{lunn2013fully} is useful for this situation. We explore an alternative approach when optimization can be used to find the individual posteriors.

The initial stage (``stage I'') of the method we propose begins by first optimizing $[\bt_i|\by_i]/[\bt_i]$ = $[\by_i|\bt_i]$ with respect to $\bt_i$ for each data set or partition. This results in the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) $\hat{\bt}_i$ for the data $\by_i$. Then if the data are informative enough, we can approximate 
\[
\frac{[\bt_i|\by_i]}{[\bt_i]} \approx \text{N}(\bt_i|\hat{\bt}_i, \hat{\bS}_i)
\]
where $\hat{\bS}_i$ is the negative inverse Hessian of the log-likelihood. This is the standard large-sample asymptotic results for an MLE. Without any further assumptions, the desired posterior is approximated by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:normpost}
[\bp,\bT|\bY] \approx  \prod_{i=1}^n\left(\text{N}(\hat{\bt}_i|\bt_i, \hat{\bS}_i)\ [\bt_i|\bp]\right)\ [\bp].
\end{equation}
Note, in (\ref{eq:normpost}), we have put $\bt_i$ in the mean position of the normal specification. Due to the symmetry of the normal density function it is equivalent, but this way $\hat{\bt}_i$ can be interpreted as an observation while $\bt_i$ retains its random effect interpretation. In essence, the information in the original likelihood, $[\by_i|\bt_i]$ about $\bt_i$ was compressed into the approximate likelihood $\text{N}(\hat{\bt}_i|\bt_i, \hat{\bS}_i)$. The benefit of stage I is that this compression can be accomplished separately and in parallel for each unit. In ``stage II,'' we can make full inference for all model parameters by maximizing the approximate full posterior (\ref{eq:normpost}) to obtain the posterior mode $(\tilde{\bp},\tilde{\bT})$, or {\it maximum a posteriori} (MAP) estimate and the negative inverse Hessian of the log posterior density estimates posterior covariance matrix. We use hats to represent stage I estimates and tildes to represent stage II estimates.

In practice, there exists the possibility that $\bt_i$ is only weakly identified in $[\by_i|\bt_i]$. Using the complete data, $\bY$, within the hierarchical model provides the information necessary to identify $\bt_i$. So, maximizing the posterior $[\bt_i|\by_i] = [\by_i|\bt_i][\bt_i]$ might be necessary, where $[\bt_i]$ is chosen to make all parameters identifiable. Because we are free to choose the temporary prior to aid stage I model fitting, we suggest using a normal prior
\[
[\bt_i] = \text{N}(\bt_i|\bt_0, \bS_0).
\]
A reparameteriztion of $\bt_i$ might be necessary such that a normal density is appropriate as a prior, but this will only help the normal approximation in stage I anyway. Now with the use of the temporary prior, the approximation becomes \citep{goudie2019joining},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pseudo.prior}
\frac{[\bt_i|\by_i]}{[\bt_i]} \approx \frac{\text{N}(\bt_i|\Check{\bt}_i, \Check{\bS}_i)}{\text{N}(\bt_i|\bt_0, \bS_0)} \propto \text{N}(\bt_i|\hat{\bt}_i, \hat{\bS}_i),
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pprior.remove}
\hat{\bS}_i = \left(\Check{\bS}_i^{-1} - \bS_0^{-1}\right)^{-1} 
\ \ \text{and}\ \ 
\hat{\bt}_i = \hat{\bS}_i \left(  \Check{\bS}_i^{-1}\Check{\bt}_i -  \bS_0^{-1}\bt_0\right),
\end{equation}
where $\Check{\bt}_i$ and $\Check{\bS}_i$ are the MAP and large sample covariance matrix of $\log [\bt_i|\by_i]$. Thus, we can still use the same form (\ref{eq:normpost}) as before, however, we must account for the effect of the temporary prior for stage II estimation. 


\subsection{Normal random effects models}

While there is no requirement that $\bT$ be normally distributed in (\ref{eq:normpost}), it is the case in the vast majority of applications. For many applications $\bt_i$ can be parameterized such that a normal distribution is appropriate. So, for the remainder of the paper, we will assume that, 
\[
[\bt_i|\bb, \bSig] = \text{N}(\bt_i|\bX_i\bb, \bSig).
\]
When this is the case, stage II becomes equivalent to fitting a multivariate normal random effects regression model. 

First we reparameterize the model using $\bt_i = \bX_i\bb + \bu_i$ where $[\bu_i|\bSig] = \tN(\mathbf{0},\bSig)$. Now, the posterior of interest is approximated with
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:normeff}
[\bb,\bSig,\bU|\bY] \approx  \prod_{i=1}^n\left(\tN(\hat{\bt}_i|\bX_i\bb+\bu_i, \hat{\bS}_i)\cdot \tN(\bu_i|\mathbf{0},\bSig)\right)\ [\bb, \bSig].
\end{equation}
This is equal to the multivariate linear mixed model
\[
\hat{\bt}_i = \bX_i\bb + \bu_i + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i
\]
with random effect $\bu_i \sim \text{N}(\mathbf{0},\bSig)$ and error $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i \sim \text{N}(\mathbf{0},\hat{\bS}_i)$. We can write this in full matrix form as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:full.mat.form}
\hat{\bT} = \bX\bb + \bU + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
\end{equation}
where all the model terms are concatenated, $\hat{\bT} = (\hat{\bt}_1',\dots,\hat{\bt}_n')'$, $\bX = (\bX_1',\dots,\bX_n')'$, $\bU \sim \tN(\bz, \bI_n\otimes\bSig)$, and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \tN(\mathbf{0}, \text{diag}(\hat{\bS}_1,\dots,\hat{\bS}_n))$. We use the notation `$\text{diag}(\dots)$' to represent a block-diagonal matrix. 

The preceding description is how random effects meta-analysis is most often considered \citep{higgins2009re}. Traditionally, a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimate of the variance terms combined with generalized least-squares estimate of the fixed effects, $\bb$, is used to estimate parameters and perform predictions, $\tilde{\bt}_i = \bX_i\bb + \tilde{\bu}_i$. Both \citet{burnham2002evaluation} and \cite{zeppelin2019migratory} demonstrate the REML approach for fitting a random effects BHM. However, the usual REML approach does not fully account for uncertainty of the variance estimates in these predictions and other estimation methods, such as MCMC, are necessary. We use the {\tt R} package {\tt TMB} to fit (\ref{eq:normeff}). A Laplace approximation is used to integrate over $\bu$, then a generalized delta-method \citep{Dorfman:1938af, ver2012invented} is employed to estimate $\bu$ accounting for uncertainty in the other parameters \citep{kristensen2016tmb,skaug2006automatic}. 






\subsection{Modeling fixed effects and distinct parameters}

We now revisit the case where there are distinct individual effects ($\bg_i$) and global fixed parameters ($\bn$) in the data model that cannot be easily reparameterized to higher levels in the hierarchy. At first glance, these parameters might seem different but they can both be considered as population-level fixed effects. Let $\bvt_i = (\bt_i', \bn', \bg_i')'$ and $\ba = (\bn', \bg_1',\dots,\bg_n')'$, the augmented fixed parameter vector, correspondingly, $\ba_i = (\bn', \bg_i')'$. Then we can still represent the stage II model with the matrix forms
\[
\hat{\bvt}_i = \bL_i\bb^* + \bZ_i\bu_i + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i
\]
where $\bb^* = (\bb', \ba')'$, $\bL_i = \text{diag}(\bX_i, \bK_i)$, $\bK_i$ is a $|\ba_i|\times |\ba|$ indicator matrix that selects the appropriate parameter, and $\bZ_i$ is a $|\ba_i|\times |\bt_i|$ indicator matrix that selects $\bu_i$ to align with the $\bt_i$ portion of $\bvt_i$. Concatenating vectors and matrices over $n$ units results in  the full version:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:full2stage}
\hat{\bvt} = \bL\bb^* + \bZ\bu + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}.
\end{equation}
The normally distributed components $\bu$ and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ have the same variance as in the previous section. We can now optimize the stage II linear mixed model likelihood subject to the prior distributions on $\{\bb, \bSig, \bn, \bG\}$ to find the MAP for all the model parameters.   


\subsection{Stage III: revisiting stage I}  

Using the description to this point, we are set to perform a 2-stage model fitting a CIHM. However, in our initial analysis of the data in the forthcoming Section 4, we noticed that when there is imbalance between data sets in the amount of information for estimating population parameters the feedback desired from using (\ref{eq:full2stage}) for full model inference of $\bg_i$ can be lacking. Therefore, we propose revisiting stage I estimation to update $\bg_i$ given the results of the second stage. 

To begin the description of the proposed stage III, consider the simple data model structure:
\begin{equation}
\by_1 \sim [\by_1|\bn]\ \text{ and } \by_2 \sim [\by_2|\bn,\bg_2].
\end{equation} 
Further, suppose that $\bn$ is nearly unidentifiable in $[\by_2|\bn,\bg_2]$, whereas it is fully identifiable in $[\by_1|\bn]$. In stage I, we can obtain well informed estimates $\hat{\bn}_1$ and $\hat{\bS}_1$. However, for $\by_2$, we will have to use a temporary prior distribution and correct the initial parameter estimates with (\ref{eq:pprior.remove}). This can leave the portions of $\hat{\bS}_2^{-1}$ associated with $\hat{\bn}_2$ and $(\hat{\bn}_2, \hat{\bg}_2)$ very small or near $\mathbf{0}$. In the second stage, all information for updating $\hat{\bg}_2$ by fitting (\ref{eq:full2stage}) is contained in these same portions of $\hat{\bS}_2^{-1}$. In the extreme case that these portions are exactly $\mathbf{0}$ one can show that, in stage II, $\tilde{\bn}_2 \to \tilde{\bn} = \hat{\bn}_1$ (the stage I estimate) and $\tilde{\bg}_2$ remains unchanged from stage I. So, we see satisfactory updating of $\hat{\bn}_2$, but no updating of $\hat{\bg}_2$ in stage II. This case is admittedly somewhat pathological, but it illustrates that the Hessian matrix of $[\by_2|\bn=\hat{\bn}_2, \hat{\bg}_2]$ may not be the best representation of the likelihood shape at $\bn = \tilde{\bn}$, the stage II estimate. 

To adjust for this scenario, we consider revisiting the stage I analysis, if warranted, for one or more $\bg_i$. Stage III proceeds as follows. First we let $\bxi_i$ represent all parameters except $\bg_i$, from stage II, we obtain the posterior approximation:
\[
[\bxi_i|\bY] \approx \tN(\bxi_i\mid \tilde{\bxi}_i, \widetilde{\bV}_{\xi_i}),
\]  
where $\widetilde{\bV}_{\xi_i}$ is the negative inverse of the Hessian of the log-posterior distribution represented by the stage II model (\ref{eq:full2stage}) and the associated prior distributions. From this approximation we can obtain an updated mean and covariance matrix for the full posterior approximation such that
\[
[\bg_i ,\bxi_i|\bY] \approx \tN((\bg_i ,\bxi_i) \mid \bar{\bm}, \overline{\bV}),
\]
where $\bar{\bm} = (\bar{\bg}_i,\tilde{\bxi}_i)$, $\bar{\bg}_i$ is the value that maximizes the conditional likelihood $[\by_i|\tilde{\bt}_i, \tilde{\bn}, \bg_i]$ and $\overline{\bV}$ is a updated covariance that propagates uncertainty in $\tilde{\bxi}_i$ when assessing the variance of the new estimate. To calculate $\overline{\bV}$, we need to define the matrices: 
\[
\begin{gathered}
\mathbf{H}_{\gamma\gamma} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bg_i \partial \bg_i'} \log[\by_i|\tilde{\bt}_i, \tilde{\bn}, \bar{\bg}_i] 
\text{ and }
\mathbf{H}_{\gamma\xi} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bg_i \partial \bxi_i'} \log[\by_i|\tilde{\bt}_i, \tilde{\bn}, \bar{\bg}_i].
\end{gathered}
\] 
Now we can use the generalized delta-method to approximate the full covariance matrix \citep{kass1989approximate, skaug2006automatic}:
\[
\begin{gathered}
\overline{\bV} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} -\mathbf{H}_{\gamma\gamma}^{-1} & \bz \\ \bz & \bz \end{array}\right] + 
\mathbf{J} \widehat{\bV}_{\xi_i} \mathbf{J}',  \text{ where } 
\mathbf{J} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} -\mathbf{H}_{\gamma\gamma}^{-1}\mathbf{H}_{\gamma\xi} \\ \mathbf{I}_{\xi} \end{array}\right].
\end{gathered}
\]
Note that this can be replicated for any $\bg_i$ because the row of $\mathbf{H}_{\gamma\xi}$ associated with another $\bg_j$ will be equal to zero, an update to $\bg_i$ will not be affected by the value and variance of any other $\tilde{\bg}_j$. So, stage III in the multistage analysis is to update any $\tilde{\bg}_i$ desired. This may not be applicable in all situations, because one must be able to evaluate $[\by_i|\tilde{\bt}_i, \tilde{\bn}, \bg_i]$ for various parameter values. In addition, one also needs to be able to evaluate the full Hessian at various parameter values. This may not be possible, depending on the software used in stage I. 


\section{Example I: A generalized linear mixed model} \label{sec:moose.wolf}

We present a simple random effects logistic regression model used to analyze data on occurrence of moose ({\it Alces alces}) browsing in willow stands with respect to presence of wolves ({\it Canis lupis}). These data were originally presented and analyzed by \cite{van2018does}. Although these data are not large in the modern sense, we demonstrate a 2-stage analysis here because the model can easily be fit in its full hierarchical form for comparison. 

\subsection{Moose data and model}

This example involves $n =$ 2,914 binary responses, $y_{ij}$, which indicate presence of moose browsing on tree $j=1,\dots,n_i$ of plantation $i=1,\dots,24$. The original study assessed whether or not tree browsing is reduced in plantations exposed to high wolf activity. In addition, the study accounted for inherent moose preferences for tree height. To perform a similar analysis, we use a random effects model to treat each plantation as a unit to learn about the fixed effect of high wolf presence on moose browsing while accounting for natural variation in moose response across the 24 plantations. The CIHM is given by
\[
\begin{gathered}
y_{ij} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_{ij}) \\
\text{logit}(p_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{height}}h_{ij} + \beta_{\text{wolf}}w_i + u_{0i} + u_{\text{height},i} h_{ij}\\
\mathbf{u}_i = (u_{0i}, u_{\text{height},i}) \sim \text{N}(\mathbf{0},\text{diag}(\sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2))
\end{gathered}
\]
where $h_{ij}$ equals the height of the $j$th tree in the $i$th plantation and $w_i$ is a binary indicator of high wolf presence in the $i$th plantation.

To use the 2-stage approach we must hierarchically center the model because $\beta_0$ and $\beta_{\text{wolf}}w_j$ are not identifiable within plantation units. After centering, the model can be rewritten as,
\[
\begin{gathered}
\text{logit}(p_{ij}) = \theta_{0i} + \theta_{\text{height},i}h_{ij},\\
\bt_i = (\theta_{0i}, \theta_{\text{height},i}) \sim \text{N}(\mathbf{X}_i\bb, \text{diag}(\sigma^2_1, \sigma^2_2)) ,
\end{gathered}
\]
where
\[
\mathbf{X}_i = \left[ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & w_i \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\right].
\]

\subsection{Fitting details}

To effectively use the 2-stage approach in this example, it was necessary to use a stage I temporary prior ( \ref{eq:pseudo.prior}) and (\ref{eq:pprior.remove}) because browsing is rare (or absent) in some of the plantations. We used the normal $g$-prior \citep{hanson2014informative} where $\bt_0 = \mathbf{0}$, $\bS_0 = \pi^2 n_i (\mathbf{H}_i'\mathbf{H}_i)^{-1}/6$, and $\mathbf{H}_i$ is the usual design matrix with a column for intercept and the other containing tree height ($h_{ij}$). This prior produces $p_{ij}$ that are approximately uniform(0,1) distributed for a randomly selected  $h_{ij}$. The effect of this prior was removed using (\ref{eq:pprior.remove}) before stage II.

For stage I model fitting we used two approaches. In the first version (A), we fitted each individual model using the {\tt R} package {\tt mgcv} \citep{wood2011fast} to obtain the posterior mode and Hessian covariance matrix from $[\bt_i|\by_i] \propto [\by_i|\bt_i][\bt_i]$. The ``{\tt paraPen}'' argument of the {\tt mgcv} function {\tt gam} can be used to fit a logistic regression subject to a prior constraint on the coefficients. In the second version (B), we used the approximate posterior mean and covariance matrix obtained from a deterministic posterior sampling procedure detailed in Appendix \ref{sec:methodii} \citep{johnson2011bayesian,Rue:2009uq}. This deterministic procedure estimates the posterior mean and variance without asymptotic results. For version B, the likelihood must be calculated with bespoke code. We are not aware of any production-level software that returns only the value of the posterior for logistic regression, which makes this version more challenging in practice than the first version, but we explored here nonetheless.  

In stage II we used {\tt TMB} to fit the linear mixed model in (\ref{eq:full.mat.form}). In {\tt TMB}, Laplace approximation is used to numerically integrate over the random effect $\bu$ to maximize the likelihood for only the fixed effects \citep{kristensen2016tmb}. The {\tt TMB} package then uses the generalized delta method to calculate the covariance matrix for both the fixed and random effects. 

\subsection{Results}
We examined predictive estimates of $\bt_i$, namely $\tilde{\bt}_i = \bX_i\tilde{\bb} + \tilde{\bu}_i$, fixed effects $\bb$, and variance parameters $(\log\sigma_1, \log\sigma_2)$ with respect to the full MCMC. Both versions of the 2-stage approach produced results similar to a gold standard MCMC analysis of all the data simultaneously (Figures \ref{fig:theta.re} and \ref{fig:fixed.re}). Heuristically, for both $\bt_i$ and $\bSig$,  the mean and covariance matrix obtained from stage I, version B (deterministic posterior sample), produced estimates more similar to the full-model MCMC estimates than those derived from the Bayesian MAP fitting with {\tt mgcv}, but only slightly so. Scientific inference for any of the three methods would be nearly identical, especially for the fixed parameters $\bb$. There is little evidence for an effect of wolf presence on moose browsing in this example. 



\section{Example II: An Integrated Data Model}

Integrated Data Models (IDM), initially proposed in a demographic context (Integrated Population Models; IPM) by \cite{besbeas2002integrating}, are routinely used to collect information in multiple sparse data sets for improved inference on a shared parameter, $\bn$. The typical IDM \citep{schaub2011integrated} has the form
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\by_i \sim [\by_i|\bg_i, \bn], \\
&(\bg_1,\dots,\bg_n) \sim [\bg_1]\cdots[\bg_n],\\
&\bn \sim [\bn],
\end{aligned}
\]
where $\bg_i$ are data-type distinct parameters and $\bn$ are common parameters. Traditionally, there are no random effects in IDM (IPM) models. Multiple data sets are used to obtain better estimates of the common parameters, $\bn$, than can be obtained from any single $\by_i$. 

\subsection{Lapwing data and models}

To demonstrate the 2-stage meta-analysis approach for IDM model fitting, we analyze the northern lapwing ({\it Vanellus vanellus}) data from \cite{besbeas2002integrating}. These IDM data consist of $n=2$ data sets, a ring-recovery data set, $\by_1$ and an index measure of adult birds obtained from a generalized additive model of counts, $\by_2$. These data have been analyzed many times to demonstrate IDM methodology for ecological data \citep{besbeas2002integrating, Brooks:2004zi, besbeas2019exact, goudie2019joining}. Therefore, we compare the approximate 2-stage method to various other inferential techniques, including the Kalman filter and MCMC. 

Ring-recovery models are based on marking animals and releasing them back into the wild. Over following time intervals (occasions), the marked animals are recovered after they have died. In this study lapwings were released and recovered annually from 1963--1997. The likelihood for this type of model is a product-multinomial where numbers of ring-recoveries in the following years are multinomial distributed with cell probabilities
\[
p_{it} = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll}
(1-\phi_{t-1})\lambda_t & \text{ for } t=i+1 \\
(1-\phi_{t-1})\lambda_t\prod_{t'=I}^{t-2} \phi_{t'} & \text{ for } i+2 < t \le T \\
1-\sum_{t'=i}^J p_{it'} & \text{ for } t=T+1
\end{array} \right. ,
\]
where $p_{it}$ is the probability that an animal ringed in year $i$ is recovered in year $t$. The last year of the study is denoted with $T$, ($t=T+1$ is for animals never recovered), $\lambda_t$ is the probability of recovering an animal in year $t$ given it died over the previous year, and $\phi_t$ is the probability of surviving from year $t$ to $t+1$. In this study all individuals are ringed as young-of-the-year. 

To assess the influence of weather on survival and trends in recovery, the ring-recovery parameters are modeled with 
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\text{logit}(\phi_{yt}) = \eta_{y0} + \eta_{y1} x_t,\qquad \text{logit}(\phi_{at}) = \eta_{a0}+ \eta_{a1} x_t,\\
\text{logit}(\lambda_t) = \gamma_{0\lambda} + \gamma_{1\lambda} t,
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{yt}$ is the survival of first year birds in year $t$ (for animals ringed in year $t-1$), $\phi_{at}$ is adult female survival in year $t$, and $x_t$ is the number of days below freezing in year $t$. 

The census index data consist of noisy measures of female adult lapwing abundance in the study area, $\by_2$. These abundance measurements exist from 1995--1998. To make inference about population dynamics we use the state-space model of \citet{besbeas2002integrating},
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
N_{y,t+1} = \phi_{yt} \rho_t N_{at} + \epsilon_{yt};\qquad \varepsilon_{yt} \sim \tN(0, \phi_{yt} \rho_t N_{at}),\\
N_{a,t+1} = \phi_{at} (N_{yt} + N_{at}) + \epsilon_{at};\qquad \varepsilon_{at} \sim \tN(0, \phi_{at} (1-\phi_{at}) N_{at}),\\
y_{t} \sim \tN(N_{at}, \sigma^2),
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
where $N_{yt}$ is the number of yearling females in year $t$, $N_{at}$ is the number of adult females in year $t$, $\rho_t$ is the rate at which female offspring are produced in year $t$, and $y_t$ are the noisy observations of adult female abundance. The survival parameters are the same as the ring-recovery model, but the production is modeled on the log scale using
\[
\log (\rho_t) = \gamma_{0\rho} + \gamma_{1\rho} t.
\]
Adult birds are the only component of the bivariate abundance state that is (indirectly) observed, so, there is little information in these data to inform all survival and production parameters. This is how the IDM allows inference to be made on all the parameters of the joint model, 
\[
\begin{gathered} 
\bn = (\eta_{y0}, \eta_{y1}, \eta_{a0}, \eta_{a1})',  \\
\bg_1 = (\gamma_{0\lambda}, \gamma_{1\lambda})' \text{, and } \bg_2 = (\gamma_{0\rho}, \gamma_{1\rho}, \log\sigma, \log N_{y0}, \log N_{a0})'.
\end{gathered}
\]
This IDM is an example of a CIHM model with common parameters, $\bn$, as well as distinct parameters, $\bg_1$, and $\bg_2$. 

We also consider an additional complexity beyond the traditional IPM specification. One of the tenants of the IPM is that the multiple data models share common parameters of scientific interest; here, the survival parameters, $\bn$. It seems reasonable, however, that differences in data collection procedures or model specification might imply separate ``true'' values of the survival parameters, that is, $\hat{\bn}_i$ is actually estimating $\bn_i\ne\bn$. So, one might consider each $[\by_i|\bn,\bg_i]$ to be an imperfect source of information about $\bn$. This is how meta-analysts would traditionally envision combining these separate studies. Therefore, we also fit a model where $\bn_i$ is a random effect, 
\[
\bn_i \sim \tN(\bn, \sigma^2_\eta\bI).
\]
If the available data support common survival parameters between the two data sets, then $\hat{\sigma}_\eta$ will be small and all the stage II estimates of $\tilde{\bn}_i \approx \bn$. However, if $\sigma_\eta \gg 0$, then a fixed $\bn$ model is probably inappropriate and there are possible biases in one or both of the different data sets. Thus, $\sigma_\eta$ serves as a regulator to assess the degree to which the data sets support a fixed $\bn$ value.

\subsection{Fitting details}
 
In each of the previous studies that analyze these data, bespoke code was written in software such as {\tt Matlab}, {\tt JAGS} \citep{plummer2003jags}, {\tt NIMBLE} \citep{de2017programming} or some other language to optimize the joint likelihood (integrated over latent abundance) or execute an MCMC. For a rather simple IDM model like this, that is relatively straightforward. But for more complicated capture-recapture models or abundance  models this can become an impediment for practitioners. Many of the individual submodels in IDMs have software available for fitting them separately. For the ring-recovery data in this analysis there has been production-level software to fit the model for over 20 years. Thus it seems proper that we should be able to utilize this substantial development in capture-recapture data analysis. 

To demonstrate how we might utilize production software, in the first stage, we fitted the ring-recovery model using {\tt MARK} \citep{white1999program} via the user interface {\tt R} package {\tt RMark} \citep{laake2013:RMark}. {\tt MARK} provides the MLE and the large-sample covariance matrix, $\hat{\ba}_1 = (\hat{\bn}_1, \hat{\bg}_1)'$ and $\hat{\bS}_1$.  We used bespoke model code written for analysis with the {\tt R} package {\tt TMB} \citep{kristensen2016tmb}. However, the state-space model is the simpler of the two in terms of programming complexity. From {\tt TMB} we obtain the MAP estimate and large-sample covariance matrix, $\hat{\ba}_2 = (\hat{\bn}_2, \hat{\bg}_2)'$ and $\hat{\bS}_2$. Because the survival and production parameters are not well identified in the state-space model, we used vaguely informative temporary stage I prior distributions. For $(\eta_{y0},\eta_{y1})$ and $(\eta_{a0},\eta_{a1})$ we used independent normal $g$-priors to induce approximately uniform priors on $\phi_{yt}$ and $\phi_{at}$ \citep{hanson2014informative}. For the production parameters, $(\gamma_{0\rho},\gamma_{1\rho})$ we used a normal $g$-prior such that $\rho_t$ lies within [0.01, 2] with prior probability $\approx 0.95$. Based on other analyses, this prior covers a fairly broad range of values for the average number of females produced per female. For the remaining parameters, temporary priors were not used. After the MAP was obtained, it was adjusted for use of the temporary priors with (\ref{eq:pprior.remove}) before the second stage. In stage II, we used the linear mixed model in (\ref{eq:full2stage}) along with the population prior distributions:
\[
\begin{gathered}[]
[\eta_{y0}, \eta_{y1}, \eta_{a0}, \eta_{a1}] = \tN(\mathbf{0}, 10^2\bI),\\
[\gamma_{\lambda 0}, \gamma_{\lambda 1}] = \tN(\mathbf{0}, 10^2\bI),\ [\gamma_{\rho 0}, \gamma_{\rho 1}] = \tN(\mathbf{0}, 10^2\bI) \\
[\log N_{y0}, \log N_{a0}] = N(0, 1000^2\bI),\ [\log \sigma] \propto \text{constant (improper)}, \text{ and}\\
[\sigma_\eta] = \text{Exponential}(1) \text{ (for the random $\bn_i$ model)}.
\end{gathered}
\] 

\subsection{Results} 

To judge the quality of the posterior approximation we compared our results to those presented by \citet{besbeas2019exact}, hereafter, B\&M. Table 2 (pg. 483) of that publication provides the results of a full joint analysis for several different models and inference methods. Our specification is most similar to their ``MLE KF'' model. That is a model where $\log N_{y0}$ and $\log N_{a0}$ are explicitly estimated.  We only compare our results to that model (Figure \ref{fig:ipm}), but the other results are very similar. All of the multistage approximate fitting methods produced results very similar to  the B\&M results (Figure \ref{fig:ipm}). A full table of the multistage results is available in Appendix B. For the 2 and 3 stage fixed $\bn$ models, estimates of $\bn$ were virtually indistinguishable from those given by B\&M, both point estimates and standard deviations. Also, the band reporting parameters, $\bg_1$, are nearly identical. From stage II to stage III, $\bar{\gamma}_{\rho 1}$ became more similar to the B\&M results while $\bar{\gamma}_{\rho 0}$ became less similar. Although they are both close to the B\&M results overall. A real improvement in matching the simultaneous model fit estimates from stage II to III is evident in the $\log \sigma$, $\log N_{y0}$ and $\log N_{a0}$ parameters, with all of them becoming nearly equivalent to the B\&M estimates after stage III.  

We now turn our attention to the random effect $\bn_i$ version of the model. The estimate of $\tilde{\sigma}_\eta$ = 0.017 (0.006--0.049), which is small, but not trivially so. So, there is some evidence that each data set contains different information about the survival process. The population-level effect of frost days on survival becomes slightly steeper and more uncertain (Figure \ref{fig:ipm} and Appendix B) for young animals. For adult animals, frost days have less effect on survival, but this is again, more uncertain. The increase in uncertainty and change in frost effect are plainly evident when examining survival on the natural scale (Figure \ref{fig:surv}). Although they did not fit separate survival processes, \citet{goudie2019joining} noted this discrepancy as well in their 2-stage MCMC analysis of this same data.          


\section{Discussion}

We have proposed a multistage method for estimating parameters in a broad class of BHMs, the CIHMs. Our approach is computationally efficient and flexible. This method draws inspiration from traditional meta-analysis where individual studies using differing methods contribute unit-level parameter estimates which are then combined using a CIHM format. In stage I, practitioners can use software designed for a particular data model. We use traditional GLM/GAM software in the first example, and a mixture of production software ({\tt MARK}/{\tt RMark}) and pseudo-coding software ({\tt TMB}) in the IDM example. In addition, as with other 2-stage methods, the stage I analyses are ``embarrassingly parallel,'' so, they can be executed in parallel if necessary. In stage II, the multivariate linear mixed model is very quick to analyze because the dimension of the problem is substantially reduced from the data model. The linear mixed model represents a compression of the information in the various data sets about the parameters. Finally, the generalized delta-method allows one to revisit the estimates of distinct parameters that is usually not possible in traditional meta-analysis because the raw data are not available.  

We developed the proposed multistage method under the assumptions of the CIHM (\ref{eq:full.model}), however, we  can relax some of the independence assumptions in the CIHM and the method is still valid in its current form. First, the data do not need to be strictly independent at the unit-level. That is, the multistage method can still be applied when the data models can be partitioned as
\[
\bY \sim \prod_i[\by_i|\by_{-i}, \bt_i, \bg_i, \bn],
\]
where, $\by_{-i} = \{\by_1,\dots,\by_{i-1},\by_{i+1},\dots,\by_n\}$. Having a meaningful partition of the data is not the important part of any multistage analysis, it is the ability to partition the data-level model \citep{hooten2018prior}. In stage I, these dependent data models can be individually fitted in the same way. Second, the unit-level normal random effects, $\bt_i$ do not need to be independent either, they can have joint distribution $\bT  \sim \tN(\bX\bb, \bO)$; all that changes is that $\bu$ has variance $\bO$ instead of $\bI_n \otimes \bSig$ in the stage II linear mixed model (\ref{eq:full.mat.form} and \ref{eq:full2stage}). This means that practitioners can use, for example, spatially or temporally correlated random effects. 

In addition to relaxing the original CIHM descriptions, we also consider our method as a base-level version from which we can expand to be suitable for situations where the approximations used may be inadequate. For example, if a single normal density does not adequately approximate the data model in (\ref{eq:normpost}), then a normal mixture model may be more accurate \citep{gelman2013bayesian}. Instead of a single multivariate normal density function, we could use     
\[
[\by_i|\bt_i] \approx \sum_{k=1}^{K_i}\omega_{ik}\text{N}(\bt_{ik}^*|\bt_{i}, \bS_{ik}^*),
\]
where $\sum_k \omega_{ik} = 1$, and $\{\bt_{ik}^*, \bS_{ik}^*\}$ are selected in an advantageous way in stage I, then we can follow the same development in Section 2.2 to obtain the stage II model that is a mixture of linear mixed models. This is still relatively easy to fit because the weights are known. Alternatively, a centered and scaled multivariate $t$-distribution would be better if the tails of the stage I posterior densities are relatively heavy. There are numerous modifications such as these that would not greatly burden stage II optimization of the general form (\ref{eq:post}).

In addition to efficiency resulting from data partition, using optimization methods instead of sampling-based MCMC methods also increases the speed of model fitting. Both of the examples presented here can be fitted in minutes on a standard laptop. While this is not critical for the model in Example I, a recent 2-stage MCMC analysis of the data in Example II required 13.5h for a 2-stage analysis or 22h for a single stage full model analysis \citep{goudie2019joining}. This speed does come at a cost, however, as it relies on approximations in several places in the development. We do not view this as a detriment, however, because this method is designed for computationally challenging situations. These usually occur in settings with a large amount of data and hence a substantial amount of information about the parameters. That is, situations for which the large sample approximations were developed. Both of the models in our examples could readily be fitted in a single stage BHM analysis. Critically, use of the multistage method allows us to compare estimates when a full analysis is not out of the question. Even so, the multistage method produced estimates very close to the ``gold standard'' full BHM estimates.

On a broader topic, we would like to return to the random effects version of the integrated population model (IPM) in Example II. IPMs were originally proposed to pool multiple data sources for better estimation of shared parameters \citep{schaub2011integrated}. This is the same goal for meta-analysis in general. However traditional meta-analysis methods have often treated separate data sets as having their own particular biases such that the data do not really share a common parameter set. Hence, the use of random effects models in the second stage. This is something the ecological community should embrace more often. For example, there appears to be conflict between the lapwing ring-recovery data and census counts with respect to the survival process. Therefore, it is not unrealistic to think that the data models do not share exactly the same ``true'' value for these parameters. So, the random effects version of the model represents partial pooling that can provide a more honest estimate of uncertainty. \cite{bravington2018reliable} also consider this partial pooling in a 2-stage method for analyzing ecological distance sampling data and use deviations of individual unit estimates as a diagnostic tool for detecting this conflict between data and population parameters. 

Hierarchical Bayesian models have brought a wealth of analytical capability for extracting scientific signal out of complex and noisy data. Moreover they provide an honest assessment of uncertainty by accounting for many different forms of stochasticity and relationships in the observable data. By assembling relatively simple components, a complex model can emerge. With the advent of modern data collection capabilities, default methods for inference have started to become obsolete. \citet{gelfand2015hierarchical} note that BHMs have been a great benefit to science but the current rate of data acquisition and model complexity are ``beginning to stretch our computational capabilities'' and future inference will have to be the result of ``an artful mixture of model specification and approximation.'' Model building using hierarchical components is a beneficial way to build large complex models, thus it is sensible that inferential computing for these models may also be best accomplished in a hierarchical fashion.

\section{Deterministic Bayesian inference} 
\label{sec:methodii}

To this point we have only considered using the posterior mode and Hessian derived covariance matrix for the first stage normal approximation. For a large amount of data in the first stage, this might be just fine. But, we might consider using the posterior mean and variance of $\bt_i$ instead. If MCMC is used in the first stage, we  calculate the sample mean and covariance matrix. If this is the case, one might use the two-stage MCMC procedures proposed and discussed by \cite{lunn2013fully}, \cite{hooten2018prior}, and \cite{goudie2019joining}. If the number of parameters is relatively small, say $\le 6$, we propose using a deterministic sampling procedure for approximating the posterior mean and variance (see \citealt{johnson2011bayesian}). 

The deterministic procedure proceeds as follows for each $i$,.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Maximize $[\bt|\by]$, to obtain the posterior mode, $\hat{\bt}$ and covariance matrix, $\hat{\bS}$
\item Form the Eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix $\hat{\bS} = \mathbf{V}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{V}'$
\item Explore the principle axes of $[\bt|\by]$ via the parameterization $\bt^{(j)} = \hat{\bt} + \mathbf{V}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{1/2}\mathbf{z}$, where $\mathbf{z}$ is successively incremented from $\mathbf{0}$ one entry at a time by step length, say $\delta_z$ until $\log[\hat{\bt}|\by]-\log[\bt^{(j)}|\by] > \delta_\pi$.
\item Repeat by successively incrementing each element of $\mathbf{z}$ by $-\delta_z$.
\item Finally, form a grid with every combination of the dimensionality $\bt^{(j)}$ entries saved in the previous two steps and retain with the same $\delta_\pi$ criterion.
\item Form weights $w_j \propto [\bt^{(j)}|\by]$
\end{enumerate}
The main benefit of the deterministic approach is that it avoids having to select a proposal distribution and assess chain convergence. The drawbacks of this approach, however, are the unknown number of likelihood evaluations and the potential coarseness in high density areas. As the number of parameters becomes large this method quickly succumbs to the curse of dimensionality.
